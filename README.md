# LEMS model simulation in Local Machine ðŸ“ƒ



## LEMS_NML2_Ex12_Net2
## LEMS_NML2_Ex2_Izh

After Reading all the documentations I am able to simluate this models in my local machine
Here are some Steps:


1. You need Clone the Repo ðŸ’»
2. First validate your model in order to simulate (It's Important) ðŸ”­

```sh
cd NeuroML model testing 
./jnml -validate MyNeuroML.nml              (validate NeuroML 2 document against the current schema)
./jnml -validatev1 MyNeuroML1.xml           (validate NeuroML v1 document against the v1.8.1 schema)
./jnml MyLEMS.xml                           (parse & simulate a LEMS model using jLEMS)
./jnml MyLEMS.xml -graph                    (generate png of structure of LEMS model using GraphViz)
./jnml MyLEMS.xml -neuron                   (generate code to run on the NEURON simulator)
```

## After validating
3. In shell
```sh
.\jnml MyLEMS.xml
```

Example 

```sh
.\jnml LEMS_NML2_Ex12_Net2.xml
```

## Simulation Output LEMS_NML2_Ex12_Net2
